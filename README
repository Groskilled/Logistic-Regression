This is a Logistic Regression in Python to predict if a student will be admitted or not given his scores on two exams. The dataset used is from the ML course by Andrew NG on Coursera.

I used matplotlib to visualize the data and the decision boundary, numpy for the matrices operations and scipy for the fmin function to get the optimal thetas.
